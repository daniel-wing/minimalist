## Intro

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a super resource that serves many pourposes. I use it to learn from other people's code, but also to store my public projects for free on the cloud (for private repos I use [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org)). GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control, and it is very powerful to organize your info but also to manage changes and contributions with order instead the natural mess we usually come up with.

Git, but specially the logic behind it, is not only for developers (I am not one) but for everyone looking to have a well orginzed place for their digital products. If you have ever face something like the next escenario, then you can benefit from using Git: ```paper.doc```, ```paper1.doc```, ```paper2.doc```, ```paper-final.doc```, ```paper-final-for-real.doc```, ```paper-final-for-real-comments-from-Dave.doc```, ```paper-new-final.doc```, ```paper-new-final-to-print.doc```, ```paper-print-without-anex.doc```

If you want to learn more about Git or GitHub (or even other distributed version control protocols like Mercurial or svn), you can visit the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) entry, the [Official Website](https://git-scm.com/) or [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/376z83/what_unusualunconventional_uses_have_you_found/) with some clever uses not releated to software development (some are using it [for law reviews](https://github.com/steeve/france.code-civil)), or this [UGFWIINI (Using Git For What It Is Not Intended)](https://public-inbox.org/git/3f4fd2640903030709r6e585d9j57ad3ae08cf38df1@mail.gmail.com/T/#m2a22bb4134907f7a4dfe8a6c1160e13bac1abf45).

## How to

I do not explain all the commands in detail. If you need extra help feel free to leave a comment or question at the bottom.

Prerequisites: You need RStudio and R installed in your computer, and a GitHub account that is free.

### TL;DR

If you just want it done copy and paste the next into your terminal.

*Usually doing something like this without understanding what you're doing is a stupid idea. I do not encourage this behavior and you should do it only if you understand the commands, but below I explian every command line in detail.*

Configure Git:

```
git config --global user.name 'daniel-wing'
git config --global user.email 'daniel.wing@gmail.com'
git config --global --list


echo "# github-n-rstudio" >> README.md
git init
git add /Users/danielwing/PRJ/test
git commit -m "first commit, uploading everything into GitHub"
git remote add origin https://github.com/daniel-wing/minimalist
```
You will be asked for your GitHub username and password

```
git push -u origin master
```
At this point return to github.com and you will see all of the content of the folder in your PC uploaded to GitHub, if you change a comma you will be able to trace that change.

### Step by step

1. Configure your username and password:
    1. ```git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'```
    1. 


1. In GitHub
    1. Create a new repository
    1. Configure the repository
1. In your PC
    1. Open the project you want to push (send, store, save) to GitHub, it can even be a new empty project
    1. Open a terminal (usually next to the Console) and type: ```git init```, this will initialized an empty Git repository in the whatever path your project iin my case is: ```/Users/danielwing/PRJ/test/.git/```
    1. Type ```echo "# Testing Git commands" >> README.md``` which basically is telling your PC to create a new file, name it README.md, and write everything between the quotation marks into it.







```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
