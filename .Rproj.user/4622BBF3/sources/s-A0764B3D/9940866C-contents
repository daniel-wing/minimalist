## Intro

I am not an expert on Blogdown nor Hugo, I am merely taking notes to myself and making them public for anyone to read in case they find them useful To go over the basic steps to get started with Blogdown and post a site online for free.

Prerequisites: You need RStudio and R installed in your computer in a different post I explain how to go over this. After this you just need to install the package Blogdown 

```{r}

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
